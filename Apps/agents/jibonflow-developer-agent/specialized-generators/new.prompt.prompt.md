<user>
read and proceed as per instructions in #file:prompt-engineer-agent.md  here is last agent response #file:last.md
analyze the last agent response using #think and then use #todos to generate the next agent. but before anything push git and then continue
</user>
<assistant>
I'll first push the current changes to git, then analyze the last agent response using the Prompt Engineer Agent instructions, and create a todo list for generating the next agent. Now let me analyze the last agent response using the thinking tool as requested: Now I'll create a comprehensive todo list for generating the next agent based on my analysis: Now I'll begin working on the first todo item - creating the Developer Agent manifest: Let me read the existing agent manifest schema to ensure proper compliance: Now I'll create the JibonFlow Developer Agent directory and manifest: Let me fix the schema path: 
```

```
Let me remove the schema reference as it's not in the allowed properties: 
```

```
Now let me complete the first todo and move to the second one: Now I'll create the comprehensive agent prompt incorporating the lessons learned from my analysis: Now let me complete this todo and move to the next one: Now I'll create the Authentication System Generator as a specialized component: Perfect! I've successfully completed the core JibonFlow Developer Agent creation following the Prompt Engineer Agent v2.0 instructions. Let me create a summary of what I've accomplished and the current status: Now let me create a comprehensive README for the completed JibonFlow Developer Agent: ## 🎯 **JIBONFLOW DEVELOPER AGENT GENERATION COMPLETE**

I have successfully analyzed the last agent response using the **Prompt Engineer Agent v2.0** instructions and generated the next-phase **JibonFlow Developer Agent** following the comprehensive analysis framework.

### 📊 **Analysis Results Applied**

**Confidence Score**: 0.87 (High confidence - exceeded 0.80 threshold)

**8-Dimension Analysis Integration**:
