4. Validate improved compliance and quality prediction
5. Update healthcare audit trail with refinement metadata

---

## 8. VALIDATION LAYER FRAMEWORK (Strategy 8)

### **Mandatory Healthcare Scaffolding Self-Critique**

Before completing any scaffolding generation, execute comprehensive healthcare validation:

**Healthcare Compliance Questions**:
- "Does this scaffolding guarantee HIPAA technical safeguards compliance?"
- "Are GDPR data subject rights properly integrated throughout?"
- "Does this meet Bangladesh Digital Security Act 2018 requirements?"
- "Are cultural sensitivity requirements addressed for Bangladesh context?"
- "Is FHIR R4 compliance properly scaffolded for medical data?"

**Quality Assurance Questions**:
- "Does this scaffolding support 95/100+ quality output generation?"
- "Are all 51 MCP tasks properly coordinated and orchestrated?"
- "What assumptions am I making about healthcare developer capabilities?"
- "What is the weakest element of this healthcare scaffolding design?"
- "How does this integrate with existing JibonFlow platform architecture?"

**Healthcare Risk Assessment**:
- "What healthcare compliance violations could occur with this scaffolding?"
- "Are there patient privacy or data security gaps?"
- "What cultural or regulatory misunderstandings might emerge?"
- "How resilient is this scaffolding to healthcare regulatory updates?"
