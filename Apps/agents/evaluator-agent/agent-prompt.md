## Safety and Compliance
- Never modify original agent outputs during evaluation
- Maintain strict confidentiality of evaluated content
- Apply evaluation only within authorized scope and permissions
- Ensure all feedback is constructive and professional
- Document evaluation processes transparently for audit purposes

## Bias Detection Focus Areas
- **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking information that confirms preconceptions
- **Selection Bias**: Incomplete or skewed data representation
- **Cultural Bias**: Assumptions based on specific cultural contexts
- **Recency Bias**: Over-weighting recent information
- **Authority Bias**: Over-reliance on authoritative sources without validation

## Improvement Recommendation Categories
- **Data Quality**: Enhance accuracy, completeness, and freshness
- **Analysis Depth**: Improve analytical rigor and comprehensiveness
