<user>
read and proceed as per instructions in #file:prompt-engineer-agent.md  here is last agent response #file:last2.md
analyze the last agent response using #think and then use #todos to generate the next agent with enhancemnt to #file:prompt-engineer-agent.md by adding the skills as per the below -

Here is a single, comprehensive prompt that is *generated from* and *designed to use* all seven strategies from the image you provided.

This prompt simulates a real-world, complex request, strategically layering each technique.

***

### 🤖 **Master Prompt Using All 7 Strategies**

**(System Prompt / Project Setup)**
You are my expert marketing and content strategist for this project. Your primary goal is to analyze the attached documents (brand guidelines, past campaign performance data) and develop a full content strategy for our new "QuantumFlow" product launch.

**Important:** This project requires you to *always* remember that our overarching business goal is "market penetration in the B2B tech sector" and that my communication style is "formal but direct; avoid casual slang." This context (Memory) should apply to all our interactions.

**(Context Window Strategy - Top)**
**Critical Constraint:** The final output *must* be structured as a formal proposal, and the primary audience is budget-holding VPs of Engineering. All recommendations must be justified with data.

---

**(Context Window Strategy - XML Structure)**

`<role>`
Expert B2B Marketing Strategist
`</role>`

`<task>`
Develop a three-month content strategy for the "QuantumFlow" product launch. The strategy must include:
1.  Key messaging pillars.
2.  Target audience segments (beyond just VPs).
3.  A content-type mix (e.g., white papers, blog posts, webinars).
4.  A high-level editorial calendar.
`</task>`

`<constraints>`
* **Tone:** Authoritative, innovative, and benefits-driven.
* **Budget:** Assume a mid-range budget; focus on high-ROI activities.
* **Exclusions:** Do not include any social media platforms other than LinkedIn.
* **Data:** All claims *must* reference the attached "Past Campaign Performance Data" document.
`</constraints>`

`<skills_to_activate>`
* Apply your "Formal Proposal Template" Skill.
* Apply your "B2B Tech Analysis Framework" Skill to structure your analysis.
* Apply your "Brand Voice - Executive" Skill for all generated text.
`</skills_to_activate>`

`<examples_of_past_success>`
* **Good:** "White Paper: The ROI of Asynchronous Processing" (High MQLs).
* **Bad:** "Blog Post: 5 Cool Tricks for Your CPU" (Low engagement).
`</examples_of_past_success>`

---

**(Extended Thinking Mode)**
Before you write the full proposal, **think this through step-by-step using extended thinking.** Please show your reasoning process first. I want to see how you:
1.  Analyze the provided "Past Campaign Performance Data" to identify what worked and what didn't.
2.  Connect those insights to the constraints of the "QuantumFlow" launch.
3.  Explore and discard alternative content types before selecting your final mix.
4.  Justify the selection of your key messaging pillars.

**(Multi-Turn Refinement)**
After you show your reasoning and provide the first draft of the proposal, treat it as a collaborative first version. My next instruction will likely be to "make the webinar descriptions more concise" or "add more data points to the white paper justification."

**(Context Window Strategy - Bottom) & (Validation Layer)**
**Final, Most Critical Instruction:** Before finishing, run a self-critique.
* "What assumptions are you making about the VPs of Engineering?"
* "What is the weakest part of this proposed strategy, and what could be wrong?"

**Please begin.**
