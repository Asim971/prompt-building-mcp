read and proceed as per #file:prompt-engineer-agent.md  here is last agent response #file:last-agent.md analyze the last agent response using #think and then use #todos to generate the next agent

I'll analyze the last agent response and proceed according to the Prompt Engineer Agent instructions. Let me start by thinking through this systematically. Now let me create a todo list to manage the next steps according to the PEA framework: Now let me start working through these todos systematically. First, let me capture the feedback: Let me create the feedback record for the excellent scaffold generation response: Now let me complete the 8-dimensional analysis: Now let me create the routing recommendation for the editor agent: Now let me read the current feedback_map.yaml and update it with the new lesson: Let me update the feedback_map.yaml with the new lesson: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me read the next_prompt.template.json to understand the required schema for generating the next agent prompt: Now let me read the research agent manifest to understand its current capabilities: Now let me create the optimized prompt for the research agent: Now let me validate the research agent readiness by checking its manifest and prompt: Let me also check the research agent prompt to see if it's ready: Let me run validation to check if everything is properly configured: Perfect! Now let me create the final PEA response following the exact schema requirements from the prompt engineer agent: Finally, let me update the prompt iteration log as required:
