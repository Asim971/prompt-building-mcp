Goal: Identify unmet needs and ISV opportunities in automotive manufacturing. Focus areas: 1) Supply chain optimization gaps in current D365 offerings; 2) Predictive maintenance integration opportunities; 3) Market size and competitive landscape. Analysis framework: a) Current D365 capabilities assessment; b) Gap identification vs. market needs; c) ISV product opportunity mapping; d) Technical feasibility and integration points; e) Market size estimation and customer segments. Output: Structured JSON with opportunity_categories, gap_analysis, market_potential, technical_requirements, and competitive_positioning. Include confidence scores for each finding. Constraints: Focus on automotive manufacturing specifically; consider global market but emphasize North America and Europe; validate against existing D365 partner ecosystem. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.",
